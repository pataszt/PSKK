Biography
My goal is to teach computer science to as many people as possible. I do this by creating interactive learning environments that scale. You can explore an example of my materials at learncs.online.
Iâ€™m currently teaching faculty at the University of Illinois. I teach our first course on computer science for majors and students with a deep interest in the subject. You might call it CS1. We call it CS 124.
